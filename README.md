# Exploration of Rentals Available on Airbnb Hawai`i

### Purpose : 

##### Overall Question : How can Airbnb hosts maximize their profit on Airbnb?

##### Plan : 
###### Extract data on 300 + rentals in Hawai`i focusing on
###### 1.) Rental type (entire house, single room, cottage, yurt, etc.… )
###### 2.) Rental location (Island)
###### 3.) Aggregated star – rating 
###### 4.) Number of reviews
###### 5.) Host Residence

###### Analyze data collected using R

##### Extraction:
###### Using Selenium, extracted the following .csv file
    
###### Contains 311 properties
    
###### Code can be seen below or accessed in Github


##### Analysis:
    
###### Using R, analyze the data collected.
    
###### So far, trying to clean the data collected.

###### When data is clean I will explore more questions I can answer
###### 1.) Host location vs. star reviews
###### 2.) Host location and correlation with number of reviews, rates etc.
###### 3.) I would like to see if host location effects the rentals due to new restrictive legislation in Hawai`i
