###An analysis of Airbnb propertes in Hawaii

####  The state of Hawai'i is a small jewel in the Pacific that is a popular attraction for travelers all over the world. The chain of islands offers resort style-living, beautiful views, volcanos, luaus, and much much more; however, while travelers see the whimsical side of Hawai'i locals face a much darker side . Locals have been suffering due to increased property value and costs of living, a side effect of the increasing number of un-restricted rentals. Airbnb, the popular rental service that allows individuals to make some extra money off of unused space, has faced backlash from the local population due to its business model. In 2018, Hawaii attempted to pass a restictive legistation in order to benefit the state by collecting taxes from the rentals. Though the legislation failed, it is in the process of being revised and will soon make Hawaii one of the few states that have such restrictions. With this increasing trend of states passing legistations affecting Airbnb, it is imperative that the service learns how to adapt to these changes positively. This analysis, aims to find factors that contribute to increased value and profit for hosts in the state of Hawaii. Hawaii is unique in that it includes a chain of islands that have different characteristics and attract people for different reasons. This analysis also takes advantage of Hawai'i's uniqueness to demonstrate how different characteristics of a property (i.e. amenities available, amenities offered, the type of property, rate,...) make it successful in one area, but not in another. The goal is to give evidence using data scraped from the Airbnb Hawaii website to help host increase their property value to increase their profits, thus Airbnb's.
